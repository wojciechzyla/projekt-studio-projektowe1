When it comes to travel, I am all about experiencing the best that nature and culture have to offer. I love exploring scenic vistas, indulging in local cuisine, and immersing myself in the traditions of different communities. As a Catholic, I prioritize attending mass whenever I can, and I believe that this spiritual practice adds an extra layer of meaning to my journeys. I am willing to spend a moderate amount of money on my travels, but I am also open to budget-friendly options that will allow me to stretch my resources and explore more.
