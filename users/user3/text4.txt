As a traveler who loves to explore new destinations by car, I am always seeking out opportunities to engage in my favorite sport activities, while also taking in the sights and sounds of the local culture. I love to play tennis, golf and go on long bike rides. I'm also interested in visiting historical landmarks and museums to learn about the history and culture of the places I visit. After a busy day, I like to relax and rejuvenate in a peaceful spa, where I can enjoy a variety of treatments and services. I'm not a fan of pubs or parties, but I do enjoy dining at local restaurants that offer a more sophisticated and relaxing atmosphere.
