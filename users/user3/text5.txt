For me, the perfect vacation involves exploring new destinations by car, engaging in my favorite sport activities and indulging in luxurious spa treatments. I love to play tennis, golf and swim, and I'm always looking for new ways to stay active and healthy. I'm also interested in exploring museums and historical landmarks to learn about the history and culture of the places I visit. After a long day of activity, I like to relax and unwind in a peaceful spa, where I can enjoy a variety of treatments and services designed to rejuvenate both my mind and body. I'm not interested in pubs or parties, but I do enjoy sampling local cuisine at upscale restaurants that offer a more refined and relaxed atmosphere.
