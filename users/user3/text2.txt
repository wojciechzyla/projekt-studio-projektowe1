As a traveler who loves to explore new destinations by car, I am always seeking out the best opportunities for outdoor activities, historical sightseeing and spa experiences. I am an avid golfer, and I always make sure to visit top-rated golf courses wherever I go. I also enjoy hiking, biking and water sports. I love to learn about the history and culture of the places I visit, and I often spend hours exploring museums, monuments and other landmarks. When it's time to unwind, I head to a luxurious spa for a massage, facial or other indulgent treatments. I'm not interested in pubs or parties, but I do enjoy sampling local cuisine at restaurants that offer a more relaxed and sophisticated atmosphere.
